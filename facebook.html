                          <!-- THE IDEA -->
                          <p>In Summer 2017, I joined the Design Tools team at Facebook as a Product Design Intern. I was responsible for designing a feature for Origami Studio that would improve the handoff of prototypes between designers and engineers. I took the problem from a broad idea to high fidelity versions and prototyped the interactions to improve usability.<br>
                          I worked closely with many designers and engineers but mainly my amazing mentor, Julius Tarng, who pushed me to grow as a designer and learn more about how to tackle a big problem and design a complete end-to-end feature.</p>

                          <h3>ORIGAMI SPECKIT</h3>
                          <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4><br>
                          <p>Designers hand off prototypes to engineers but currently there is no standardized way of doing
so. A lot of the designers just hand out the prototype video and ’hope for the best’. This
has sometimes led to cases in which the built version is not exactly what the designer designed.
It’s also hard for the engineers to figure out the exact interactions and states from
just the prototype video.<br>
<b>Having no standardized way of speccing leads to a lot of communication overhead which prevents both the designers and engineers from being more productive.</b></p> <br>
                          <h4>RESEARCH</h4><br>
                          <p>In order to better understand the problem I decided to talk to a few Designers and Engineers. My goal for this research was learn more about how designers currently hand off prototypes and the problems they faced. <br><br>
                            ● Designers basically handoff the video and then have the engineer figure out the motions/
interactions from that or if talk to them if there are any questions/issues with the
prototype. <br>
● Designers want to communicate the different interactions that are happening between 2 states. They also want to provide a redline spec of thedifferent states involved. <br>
● Engineers want to be able to slow-mo through the video so that they can see what’s happening when and between what states. <br>
● Engineers are looking for specific values associated with the various interactions and motion involved so that they can build the prototype accordingly. They are also looking for links to assets that they can download and use during development.
</p><br>

                          <h4>HYPOTHESIS</h4><br>
                          <p>If we create a standardized method of speccing prototypes, we will be able to: <br>
● Save time for Engineers and Designers by automating the process of speccing states,
interaction and motion.<br>
● Improve efficiency and consistency by helping enforce product standards.<br>
● Bring designers and engineers closer together through a shared language.</p><br>
<h4>DEFINING FEATURES AND DESIGNS</h4><br>
                          <p>Using the research, I was able to develop a set of features which I believed would help solve the problems designers and engineers were facing. </p><br> -->
