                          <!-- THE IDEA -->
                          <p>In Summer 2016, I joined the Pinterest team as a Product Design Intern. I was responsible for designing and prototyping various content creation flows explained below. I took the flows from the conceptual stage to iterative high fidelity versions and prototyped interactions to improve the feel and usability. I worked on the prototypes in native iOS(Swift).<br>
                          I worked closely with many Designers, Product Managers, Developers and User Researchers but mainly my two amazing mentors, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/gothep/">Patrik Gothe</a> and <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/annieteng/">Annie Teng</a> who pushed me to grow in both Visual and Interaction Design.<br>
                          Some of my favorite projects are detailed below. One of the flows I worked on during my internship led to a 10% increase in Daily content created and got launched to a 100% on Mobile. <br></p>

                          <br><br><br><br>

                          <h3>PIN ANOTHER</h3>
                          <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4><br>
                          <p>If Pinners want to save multiple pins from the same URL they have to go through the Pin Create Flow repeatedly. The Pin Create Flow is one of the core flows responsible for bringing in new content in to Pinterest through the In App Browser, Share Sheet, and other sources.</p> <br> 
                          <h4>THE SOLUTION</h4><br>
                          <p>After exploring and brainstorming different directions, I decided on a flow that would encourage the user to save another Pin after the user had already saved one. The flow was simple and didn't introduce anything new into the existing save flow, communicated success clearly while also allowing the user to save another. The flow was tested on Android and showed a consistent 10% increase in the Daily Pins Created and was subsequently launched to a 100% across the app. It is currently being tested on iOS and is showing similar results.</p> <br><br><p class="frame"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/181134834" width="281" height="500" style="float:200px" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

                          <h3>MULTIPINNING</h3>
                          <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4><br>
                          <p>With the Multi-Pinning Flow, I was trying to see if it's possible to improve the Pin Another Experience to allow saving multiple Pins in one flow.</p> <br> 
                          <h4>THE SOLUTION</h4><br>
                          <p>I came up with 2 solutions to improve the Pin Another experience. One of them was to allow the user to switch into a Multi-Select Mode to allow the user to select adn save multiple pins at once. The other solution was to combine the steps involved to feel like one step and allow interaction between both the steps. The two solutions are explained below:</p><br>
                          <h6>MULTI-SELECT MODE</h6><br>
                          <p>This is a flow that allows the user to go into a Multi-Select Mode to save more Pins at once. For this experience, I explored and prototyped multiple directions to see which flow would be more wholesome and engaging. The aim was to simplify the flow so as to remove any confusion around what the user has to do. I also worked on an educational flow for users who will be experiencing the flow for the first time. It is currently under development and will get released as an experiment soon.</p>

                          <br><br><!-- <img src="images/msgif3.gif" width="281px" height="500px"/><br><br><br><br><br><br> -->
                          <h6>COMBINING STEPS</h6><br>
                          <p>The Pin Create Flow involves 2 major steps; Image Picker (Picking an image to save) and Board Picker (select the board to save the Pin to). This flow allows the user to interact with both the image picker and the board picker at the same time. This was a more tricky problem to solve as it involved fundamentally rethink the Pin Create Flow. After much explorations and brainstorming, I decided on the flow that enabled the user to save more pins to a board while making better decisions about what pins to save to a board. It is also currently under development and will get released as an experiment soon.

<br><br><br><br>

                          <h3>ADD CONTENT BUTTON</h3>
                          <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4><br>
                          <p>Only 3% of the Daily Pins Created were created from the Add Button on profile which is a pretty low percentage considering that it is one of the core actions of the application. After auditing the flow and analysing what could be the possible reasons for this number, I realized that the button has an accessibility and visibility problem. It was too close to the search bar which caused many users to associate it with an option for advanced search. It was also not prominent and distinct enough to attract attention and encourage the user to save more.</p> <br> 
                          <h4>THE SOLUTION</h4><br>
                          <p>After exploring and brainstorming different directions, I decided to replace the existing add button with a Floating Action Button that would be more accessible and prominent. I designed the interaction for the floating action button and also redesigned some of the existing flows associated with the Add Button. This was a concept project for a company-wide hackathon and is on the roadmap to be go into an experiment later on in the year.</p><br><br><p class="frame"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/181277718" width="281" height="500" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

                        <h3>SKETCH PLUGIN</h3>
                          <p>My first project as an intern was to build a Sketch Plugin for the Design team at Pinterest that would increase productivity. The Sketch Plugin enabled the user to fill in dummy data into avatars and component reps using the Pinterest API.
