                          <!-- THE IDEA -->

                          <h3>THE IDEA</h3>
                          <p>Zest aims to be the go-to way to discover events on college campuses. Students around campus were always asking, “What’s going on this weekend?” or they sometimes just sit in their rooms all day because they didn’t know an event was going on. Products like Facebook Events and Eventbrite exist but the experience there wasn't made for college students and fail to provide the right platform for them. </p> <br><br><br>

                          <!-- THE TEAM -->

                          <h3>THE TEAM</h3>
                          <p>My team included myself, Haaris Khan, Mike Zhao,and Bernard Lim. Being the only designer, I worked closely with the developers. We later got another designer, Tithi Jasani. Together, we defined the product and I was able to have a second design eye which helped immensely.</p>
                          <br><br><br><br>

                          <!-- GOALS -->

                          <h3>GOALS</h3>
                          <p>The ideal product would solve the students' problems of not knowing what to do, where to go, and which of their friends are going out. These were some of the questions that we aimed to answer using the application. However, after months of work, we didn’t launch it.  There were a lot of problems on the development side that we were never satisfied with what we had.</p>
                          <br><br><br><br>

                          <!-- RESEARCH -->

                          <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
                          <p>I started out by researching how students actually found out about events on their campus. I created a  Survey and gathered 100+ responses from students from different college campuses. This helped me define what exactly I needed to focus on with a target audience of college students. I also interviewed several students and asked them about their current solutions to event discovery. The following were the biggest takeaways from the research: <br><br><br>
                            <b>1. Students rely on their friends for information.</b> 'Word of Mouth', 'Facebook', and 'Campus Advertisements' are the most popular methods of discovering events on college campuses. Majority of the students surveyed found out about events and parties through “Word of Mouth”.<br><br>
                            <b>2. Though 'Eventbrite' is popular everywhere else, it isn't used on college campuses.</b><br><br>
                            <b>3. Students love free things.</b> Some of the questions students ask are, 'Is there food?', and 'What will I gain/learn from attending the event?'<br><br>
                            <b>4. Students care about other students' opinions.</b> Interest was shown in the 'Event Review' feature. <br><br>
                            </p>
                          <br><br><br><br> 

                          <!-- TARGET AUDIENCE AND USE CASES -->

                          <h3>EXPLORATION AND BRAINSTORMING</h3>
                          <p>After analyzing the results, I started sketching out some ideas on the direction we can take with this product. I created an information hierarchy of what users would see on the event list screen versus what they would see when they are on the actual event description screen. What are the steps the user would take to create an event? What does it look like when they find an event? What shows up when the user first logs in?<br><br><br>
                            <b>TARGET AUDIENCE & USE CASES</b><br><br>
                            1. To find out what to do <br><br> 
                            2. To figure out their weekend plans <br><br>
                            3. To meet new people <br><br>
                            4. Respond to a notification or event invite<br><br>
                            5. Finding the location of an event<br><br><br>
                            The event list feature was a pretty challenging problem since it was one of the most important features of the product. It's the way users will find events at their school. I wanted this to be intuitive and I wanted users to feel comfortable using this so I explored different ideas and asked for feedback from different students. The feedback showed that a scroll-like list of events was a good option as it allowed the user to easily see the events and decide which one they might be interested in. Check out some of my ideas sketched out below. <br><br>
                            We had to figure out how exactly a user would need to use this product and what exact screens needed to be thought through. This helped understand what the actual problem was and where we can solve it. We used a persona of Alex, a normal college student attending a frat party and imagined ourselves in his shoes. What would he want to see? What would he expect when using this product? How can Zest enhance his experience of an event, before, during and even after it?
                            <br><br>We came up with many interesting ideas which included a tag search feature which would allow the user to find events using simple tags like free food, live performances etc instead of broad categories. We also came up with a way to incentivize the usage of the application by introducing a 'Prizes and Milestones' feature which would award badges to users who regularly post/find events using the application. However, we couldn't explore the idea much as we had to pause the project before we reached the stage.

                          <br><br><br><br><br><br><h3>WHAT I WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY</h3>
                          <p>The project eventually got put on hold as after months of work we lost focus and the vision with which we started. I kept trying to perfect it. My team kept coming up with new features and kept changing around the product when we should've taken a more agile approach. Another thing I wish was that i prototyped more and tested with more users.</p>
